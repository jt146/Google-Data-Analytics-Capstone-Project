# Bellabeat Case Study
This is an optional capstone project that is part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. The project involves a case study that allows us to apply the skills we have learned from the courses in the certificate program. 

### Background
Bellabeat is a high-tech company founded in 2013 that manufactures health-focused smart products for women. Urska Srsen, founder of Bellabeat, is interested in developing new Bellabeat marketing strategy for their products due to Bellabeat's success over the years and 
their potential for growth in the smart device market. She has asked the data analytics team to analyze the smart device usage data to learn how consumers use the non-Bellabeat devices.

### Business Task
The goal of this project is to determine the trends from the smart device usage and use them to develop the marketing strategy of the company. The consumer data in a non-Bellabeat smart device is retrieved, which the data is then cleaned and analyzed to gain insights of the trends. 

### Data
The datasets were retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) and were made publicly available via the user Mobius.

### Tools Used
R for Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, and Data Visualization.
